# 🌍 Traveling Website

This is a simple static travel-themed website built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It was created as part of my practice while learning web development fundamentals. The goal was to design a clean, multi-section webpage with travel-related content, including a hero section, destinations, and call-to-action buttons.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3

## 📸 Features

- Clean and structured layout  
- Header with navigation bar  
- Hero banner with background image  
- Popular destinations section with images and descriptions  
- Simple call-to-action buttons  
- Footer with contact or social info

## 🚫 What’s Missing / Improvements Needed

- ❌ Not responsive for mobile or tablet screens yet  
- ❌ No interactive JavaScript functionality  
- ✅ Planned updates: make it responsive using media queries or a CSS framework like Bootstrap

## 📖 What I Learned

- Managing fonts, images, spacing, and visual flow  
- Understanding how to build a complete web page from scratch

## 🎯 Future Plans

- Add animation and transitions for smoother user experience  
- Possibly extend it with JavaScript (e.g., image slider or form)
